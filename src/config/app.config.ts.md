## Introduction 
This code snippet sets up a basic Express.js server. It imports the necessary modules, configures the server, and exports the app object for use in other parts of the application.

## Code Walkthrough
```javascript
import express from "express";
import middlewares from "../middlewares";

const app = express();

middlewares(app);

export default app;
```

**Explanation**

* **Import Modules:**
    * `express`: Imports the Express.js framework, enabling the creation of a web server.
    * `middlewares`: Imports a module containing middleware functions.

* **Create Express App:**
    * `const app = express();`: Creates an instance of the Express application, representing the server.

* **Apply Middleware:**
    * `middlewares(app);`: Invokes the `middlewares` function, passing the app object as an argument. This function likely applies various middleware functions to the server, enhancing its functionality. 

* **Export App:**
    * `export default app;`: Exports the app object as the default export, allowing other parts of the application to access and use the server.

**Code Structure and Best Practices:**

* **Modularity:** The code separates the server setup logic from other parts of the application. This promotes code organization and maintainability.
* **Middleware Abstraction:** The use of a `middlewares` module allows for a centralized way to manage middleware functions, improving code organization and reducing redundancy.
* **Clean Code:** The code uses clear variable names and follows standard JavaScript conventions, enhancing readability and maintainability.
