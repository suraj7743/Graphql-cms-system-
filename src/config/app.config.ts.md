## 💻 Overview

This code snippet sets up the core structure of an Express.js application. It imports necessary modules, initializes the Express app, applies middleware, and exports the app for use in other parts of the application.

## 🏗️ Code Breakdown

### 📥 Imports

*   **`express`:** Imports the Express.js framework, which provides the foundation for building web applications.
*   **`middlewares`:** Imports a module containing middleware functions. These functions are designed to modify requests and responses as they flow through the application.

```javascript
import express from "express";
import middlewares from "../middlewares";
```

### ⚙️ App Initialization

*   **`const app = express();`**: Creates a new Express application instance. This instance will be used to define routes, handle requests, and manage the application's behavior.

```javascript
const app = express();
```

### 🔌 Middleware Application

*   **`middlewares(app);`**:  This line applies the middleware functions defined in the `middlewares` module to the Express application. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined, allowing for a chain of request processing steps.

```javascript
middlewares(app);
```

### 📤 Export

*   **`export default app;`**: Exports the initialized Express app as the default export of this module. This allows other modules to access and utilize the app object, such as for defining routes or starting the server.

```javascript
export default app;
```
