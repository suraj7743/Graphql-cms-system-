### Overview 

This code defines a TypeGraphQL schema using the `buildSchema` function. The schema includes resolvers for various functionalities like administration, analytics, authentication, media uploads, user management, and data dashboards.

### Imports

The code imports the following dependencies:

| Dependency | Description |
|---|---|
| `buildSchema` | From `type-graphql` package, used to construct the GraphQL schema. |
| `AdminResolver` | Resolver for admin-related functionalities. |
| `AnalyticsResolver` | Resolver for analytics-related functionalities. |
| `AuthResolver` | Resolver for authentication-related functionalities. |
| `UploadResolver` | Resolver for media upload functionalities. |
| `UserResolver` | Resolver for user management functionalities. |
| `DataDashboardResolver` | Resolver for data dashboard functionalities. |

### TypeGraphQL Class

The code defines a class named `TypeGraphQL` which encapsulates the schema definition.

### Schema() Method

The `Schema()` method is responsible for generating the GraphQL schema. 

**Functionality:**

1. **Resolver Registration:** The `buildSchema` function takes an object with the `resolvers` property. This property is an array containing all the resolvers that will be included in the schema. 
2. **Date Scalar Mode:** The `dateScalarMode` property is set to `isoDate`. This means that dates will be represented in ISO 8601 format.
3. **Validation:** The `validate` property is set to `false`, indicating that validation will not be performed during schema generation.
4. **Schema File Emission:** The `emitSchemaFile` property is set to `false`, indicating that the schema will not be emitted to a file.

**Output:**

The `Schema()` method returns a promise that resolves to the generated GraphQL schema.
