### Introduction 

This code defines a class `TypeGraphQL` responsible for building the GraphQL schema for the application. This schema acts as the blueprint for the data accessible through GraphQL queries and mutations.

### Schema Building 

The `Schema()` method is responsible for generating the GraphQL schema. 

```typescript
  async Schema() {
    return await buildSchema({
      // ... Schema configuration
    });
  }
```

The `buildSchema()` function from the `type-graphql` library is used to create the schema. It takes an object containing schema configuration details.

### Resolver Import

The `resolvers` array lists all the GraphQL resolvers responsible for handling data requests and mutations.  Each resolver class defines methods that map to specific GraphQL operations.

```typescript
      resolvers: [
        AdminResolver,
        AnalyticsResolver,
        AuthResolver,
        UploadResolver,
        UserResolver,
        DataDashboardResolver,
      ],
```

The resolvers imported include:

* **AdminResolver**: Handles operations related to administrative tasks. 
* **AnalyticsResolver**: Enables data analysis and reporting.
* **AuthResolver**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
* **UploadResolver**: Handles media uploads and file management.
* **UserResolver**: Provides access to user data and operations.
* **DataDashboardResolver**: Offers a user interface for data visualization and exploration.

### Schema Configuration

The `buildSchema()` function takes several configuration options, including:

| Option                  | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dateScalarMode`        | Specifies how dates are handled in the schema. Set to `isoDate` for ISO 8601 date format.      |
| `validate`             | Enables/disables schema validation. Set to `false` to disable validation.                       |
| `emitSchemaFile`       | Determines whether to emit a schema file. Set to `false` to prevent schema file generation.   |

```typescript
      dateScalarMode: "isoDate",
      validate: false,
      emitSchemaFile: false,
```

This configuration creates a schema without validation and doesn't generate a separate schema file.
