### Database Connection Setup Overview 

This code snippet defines and configures a database connection using TypeORM. It establishes a connection to a PostgreSQL database, retrieves configuration parameters from an `env.config` file, and sets up the necessary parameters for TypeORM to manage data entities.

### Database Configuration 

The code uses TypeORM's `DataSource` class to establish a connection to the database. This class requires specific configuration options, which are detailed below. 

### Data Source Configuration Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `type` | Specifies the type of database to connect to. In this case, `postgres` indicates a PostgreSQL database. |
| `host` | The hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL server.  |
| `port` | The port number on which the PostgreSQL server is listening. |
| `username` | The username used to authenticate with the PostgreSQL server. |
| `password` | The password used to authenticate with the PostgreSQL server. |
| `database` | The name of the database to connect to. |
| `synchronize` | Determines whether TypeORM should synchronize the database schema with the entity definitions. Setting to `true` will automatically create, update, or delete database tables based on the entities defined in the application. This should be used with caution in production environments, as it can potentially lead to data loss if not managed carefully. ðŸ’¡ It's generally recommended to use migrations instead of `synchronize` for schema management in production. |
| `logging` | Determines whether TypeORM should log its operations. Setting to `false` disables logging. |
| `entities` | An array of paths or globbing patterns specifying the locations of entity classes. This tells TypeORM where to find the classes that represent the database tables. | 
| `subscribers` | An array of paths or globbing patterns specifying the locations of event subscribers. Event subscribers allow for custom logic to be executed during database operations. |
| `migrations` | An array of paths or globbing patterns specifying the locations of migration files. Migrations are used to manage schema changes in a controlled manner, allowing for versioning and reversibility.  |
| `dropSchema` | Determines whether TypeORM should drop the existing database schema before synchronizing it. Setting to `false` prevents the schema from being dropped. |

This code snippet provides a basic example of how to establish a connection to a PostgreSQL database using TypeORM. It's important to note that this configuration is specific to this application and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your project.
